# GitHub Actions
We deploy Atlas Broker to Cloud Foundry using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

# Folder structure description

## action
The folder consists of implemented GitHub actions which are used in "workflows".
Actions available right now:
- clean-failed - triggered by deleting the branch, `purge` failed services and clean test-organization
- cleanup-cf - clean Cloud Foundry space after testing
- e2e-cf - deploy atlas broker with provided templates
- reaper - delete clusters/project from Atlas 

"e2e-cf" action have commented parts in case spring-music are more preferiable as a test application 

## base-dockerfile
The Dockerfile included here is used for actions and also contains helper functions for actions

## disabled-workflows
All disabled/cancelled/saved for future use workflows are placed in here. For example, workflow "Deploy to Amazon ECS" we plan to use it later.

## workflows
Active workflows for operating. 
- `clean-cf.yml` clean Cloud Foundry from previous usage
- `deploy-broker.yml` deploy broker to CF
- `reaper.yml` delete clusters from Atlas
- `create-release-package.yml` create a release

# Using GitHub Actions locally
Tools for successfully running pipeline locally:
- `act` [allow run GitHub action without pushing changes to repo](https://github.com/nektos/act)
- `githubsecrets` allow change/create repository [Github secrets](https://github.com/unfor19/githubsecrets)

## Req. for running act
Put the file `.actrc` to the root project folder with used secrets in GitHub

```
-s ATLAS_BROKER_URL=<url to already deployed broker, used for Deploy to Amazon ECS>
-s ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY=<private key>
-s ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY=<public key>
-s ATLAS_ORG_ID=<org_id for the templates>
-s CF_PASSWORD=<password>
-s CF_API=api.something
-s CF_USER=<user>
```

Now simply call:

```
act delete #call clean-cf workflow
act push #call deploy-broker
act <trigger>
```

!NOTE! deploy-broker workflow deletes installed services at the end. If you need to look at prepared services - uncomment/delete "Cleanup ENV for current branch" step from deploy-broker.yml

Also, `act` can use [event payload](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#delete) as an argument

```
act delete -e delete.json
```
